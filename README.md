# SAS-for-puzzle-solving

In this repository I'd like to show two sample SAS programs for solving puzzle. One is 'Eight Queen' and another is 'Sudoku'. In these programs I tried to use as easy logic as possible for make everyone understand the characteristic features and variety of functionality of SAS programming. Inthese programs, I have covered following topics of SAS programming;

1. Data step coding
2. Using of functions in data step
3. Using of arrays and loop
4. Using of basic procedures(sort, print, format)
5. Using of macro variables
6. Basic SAS macro programming
